# Influenza-Analytics

The goal for this project is to help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics
and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza
season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will
examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for
staffing needs across the country.

Motivation: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
staff.
Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and
the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.
